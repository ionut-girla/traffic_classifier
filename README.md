# traffic_classifier
The project aims to use machine learning models to classify traffic from an SDN network and compare their performance. In this sense, a simple SDN architecture will be created, which will generate traffic using the "D-ITG" utility. The traffic data thus generated is saved in a csv file using a script and then used to train and test the machine learning models used.
