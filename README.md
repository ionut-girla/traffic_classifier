# traffic_classifier
The project aims to use machine learning models to classify traffic from an SDN network and compare their performance. In this sense, a simple SDN architecture will be created, which will generate traffic using the "D-ITG" utility. The traffic data thus generated is saved in a csv file using a script and then used to train and test the machine learning models used.

In order to analyze the performance of the models used, 4 test scenarios were considered for each model.
  a. non-scaled scalar and statistical characteristics
  b. scaled scalar and statistical characteristics
  c. non-scaled scalar, statistical and complex characteristics
  d. scaled scalar, statistical and complex characteristics

The attached models are those coresponding to the 4th scenario.
